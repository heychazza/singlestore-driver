This package provides SingleStore specific schema options, currently supporting keys & shard keys, alongside setting rowstore and clusterstore tables. In addition, tables are automatically deleted one-by-one when `db:wipe` is ran, as Laravel traditionally deletes all at once - which isn't compatible with SingleStore.

A huge thanks to [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/ref/PUX1KG) for the motivation to build this package, as I never knew about SingleStore until their [blog post](https://usefathom.com/blog/worlds-fastest-analytics). 

## End of Life ðŸ˜¢
It is with regret that this package has been archived, as the SingleStore team have chosen to build their own official driver using parts from this package. So I no longer have the motivation to keep this going, and instead suggest you check out the official one found [here](https://github.com/singlestore-labs/singlestore-laravel-driver).
